    <Text>
      Before learning web development and moving to San Francisco, I worked as a
      barista and bartender in New Orleans and in Burlington, Vermont. Since
      graduating with my Associate of Science (AS) at the age of 18, I have also
      taught English in Costa Rica and worked as a landscaper in Central
      Virginia.

      In my spare time I enjoy yoga, weightlifting, and reading. Recent favorite
      book include <cite>Midnightâ€™s Children</cite> by Salman Rushdie and{" "}
      <cite>The Three-Body Problem</cite> by Cixin Liu. During the time that I
      worked as a barista, I enjoyed competing in latte art competitions.{" "}

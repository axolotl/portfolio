    <Title>Overview</Title>
    <Text>When I decided to learn web development, I knew basic HTML, CSS, and a smattering of programming knowledge from having toyed around with Python years prior. I knew nothing about React or any other modern frameworks.</Text>
    <Text>I began by working my way through the first 100 arcade problems on CodeFights, coding all of the solutions in Javascript. After that, I jumped straight into React. I purchased React Fundamentals, a course by Tyler McGinnis. I began to learn by doing projects. I worked through several Wes Bos courses. I referenced countless tutorials and read through the docs of what I was using.</Text>
    <Text>The profile on display here represents all of the knowledge and experience I have accumulated in this process. I have build projects with React and with Gatsby. I have build back ends with Express. I have used and familiarized myself with many common libraries like Redux and React Router.</Text>
    <Text>All of my major, time-consuming projects are listed under projects. Each is hosted and contains a link to the source code.</Text>
    <Text>Recently I have begun doing some exercises to build out basic applications very quickly. Those are listed under exercises.</Text>

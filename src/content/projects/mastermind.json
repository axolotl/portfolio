    "This app is a full stack build for the code-breaking game Mastermind. It is so far my most complex project in terms of interactivity and number of components. The gameplay is built with a drag and drop input field. State for the entire application is managed by Redux. Styles are applied inline via self-contained presentational components. An Express server running Sequelize and Postgres stores user scores to create a high scores tab."
